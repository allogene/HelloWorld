# HelloWorld

Doug Schiano here, exploring the world of doing instead of knowing. After 18 years of helping to design and test software I wanted to explore building software again. It has been too long since my programming days in assembler. Maybe I will learn enough to work on some of my ideas.

Some ideas:
1) Automating the functional testing by automating the automation.
2) Resumes are outdated and social media is time consuming to master. In the world of today how is there not a better way for people to find work. I have some ideas on how to improve the process, a few microservices tying information from various sources may be the answer.
3) Needs and interest change over time and the type of networking changes as well. I would like to explore ideas around how to manipulate social media networks to match my needs.
